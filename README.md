# Android with Node js server


An Android client for a chat system. The app is based on a Node js server, which means that an Android user can send a message to a web user (and the other way around). 

#### Please make sure you have Android Studio, NodeJS, and MongoDB installed on your PC before doing the following commands or nothing will work here.

In order to run the ReactJS project (the build) that will run with the NodeJS server that we wrote you will have to open
your CMD or a terminal and do the following from the **cloned directory**:
```
cd NodeJS
npm i
npm start

will run by default on port 5000 and will connect the database to "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/chat" 
In order to change those values you can do that by editing the .env.local file, make sure you put valid values (highly recommended to not touch it)

go to your browser and enter the following URL: http://localhost:5000
```

In order to run the Android client you will have to take the Chat folder and open it on Android Studio, the app is already connected to Firebase and everything, our NodeJS server is compatible with running
Android and React simultaneously, meaning that React and Android can communicate with each other, make sure to look at the Notes below beforehand, so you don't make any mistakes.
Please make sure that you have one of the latest versions of Android installed. notice that you may want to check the settings before
to make sure you are connected to your server. also notice that whenever you want to close the app make sure to logout and not terminate the app, it can cause unexpected bugs.
(since we couldn't change the API we could not support termination so that the server would know what to do).

# The pages
Our project includes 3 main pages and one setting page and an “add contact” page on the chat page.
Our pages include the same functionality and content as the previous assignment and with a new fresh design!
A user cannot get notifications when he is on the login page or registration page.

### Login
The homepage. The first screen that the user interacts with. In this screen, the user is able to log in to the website system by entering his unique username and password. The login page contains different features that will help the user in other cases: *"create a user" for cases in which the user is not registered yet. After clicking this button, the registration page will be opened.

- for a user that is trying to log in to the page, the system checks if the username and the password are related to a registered member, and if he is, he will be moved to the chat screen. Otherwise, the user will get a message saying he is not registered. As we said, the user can easily create a user by clicking the "create a user" button under the login button.
- a user cannot go into the chat page without login the login page.

### Registration
the user will interact with the screen in case he is not registered and he clicks the "create a user" button on the login page. In this screen, the user is asked to fill in different fields, such as: First name, Last name, Username, and more. The registration page also includes a double-check for passwords for the user's security. When clicking the "sign up" button, the user will be officially registered and will be joined to the website's users community. Therefore, will be able to log in to the system with his nickname and password on the login page.
•	Username is unique and therefore, if a new member wants to choose a username that is already taken the register validation won't let him create an account.
•	In our website the new member password should contain:
o	Password must contain 8 characters minimum.
o	Password must contain at least one capital letter.
o	Password must contain at least one lower letter.
o	Password must contain at least one number.
o	Username must be at least 3 characters long.
o	Profile picture has to be a picture format (if the user doesn't upload a picture our website provides a default picture).
•	If a password doesn't match the requirements above, the page won't let to create a user and a message will be shown on the screen.
•	If the password and the confirm password are not equal the page won't let to create the user.
•	The first name and last name will be shown as the display name on the chat page.

### Chat page
A registered user will interact with this screen after entering his correct username and password in the login screen.  The page consists of 3 screens: one screen for the user contacts that he has chatted with, and the second screen is for the user clicks a specific contact. The screen contains the chat with all messages between the user and his contacts. The third screen is shown when the user clicks the “add contact” button on the first screen with all the contacts. In this screen, the user is able to write a username that he wants to add to the contacts chat list (will be elaborated later). When sending a message to a user, the most recent message and its time will be shown under the contact's name. By clicking the logout button, the user will be moved back to the login page.
-	The user can't create a chat with himself.
-	We can create more than one chat with the same user.
  
### Settings
This is the setting page. The user can reach this page from any other page by clicking the settings icon at the top right or top left of the screen.
The setting page contains two main features:
- A night mode radio button – enables the user to switch from day mode to night mode and the opposite. The change is reflected by a darker design. When the user closes the app, the dark mode is reset. 
- Server URL – a tool that enables the user to move between different servers. The URL must start with http:// or https:// and has to end with a port (:PORT_NUMBER) (if there is a default port in the URL you don't have to state the port). For example http://23.54.12.34:5000 the client is automatically adding the /api/ to the URL for convenient purposes.
In addition, if the user is logged in (which means he got the setting page from the chats page), his name and profile picture will be displayed, and a logout button too.

# Communication between users
1.	Add the other user by clicking “add contact” on the chat page, inserting the other user’s username, and clicking “add contact” again.
2.	A new chat with the other user will be created and will be added to the chats list. The user will get a notification (implemented by Firebase) to his phone that the user added him.
3.	Click the other user’s name and the chat page will be opened.
4.	Write your message in the textbox and click the button on the right to the textbox.
5.	The message will be sent and will be shown on the chat history page and as the last message under the other user’s name in the chats list. 
6.	The other user will get a notification on his phone saying that he got a message from the user and the message content.

   
- The system keeps the data locally on a local database. That fact enables the user to be exposed to all the data that was before.
- When the user tries to log in, the system checks if the user was logged in before and if so, it updates his personal details with the local database while it asks the server for the updated data. If not, it deletes the database in order to keep the previous logged-in user’s privacy. One database.
- The data is updated and synchronized consistently with the server.
- Pay attention that the notification settings are on.
- Please notice that you have your Wi-Fi / cellular services activated. 
- Navigation is with the phone buttons, the app doesn't have a special button for returning, etc.
- The Android phone is on GMT+0 therefore we added manually 3 hours so it will match Israel time.
- If the message is more than 3,000 characters (sent to android) then the phone will get the message in parts (few messages)
- You can only be connected to one client, you can't be connected with the same user from React and Android, only the last login will count and you will get your messages there.
- A person has to log in every time he turns on his phone / destroy and start the app again.
- Once the person logs in, we update the local database with all the data from the server, and because of that the local database and the server are synchronized with each other.
